Zenpository: Connects gitlab to zenman's various servers.

So far, it:

- Checks to ensure it's going to an existing server based on branch prefix.
- Creates the client directory if necessary.
- Creates the project directory:
    - If there is no project yet, it clones the project.
    - If the project isn't version controlled, it git inits it.
    - If the project isn't clean or is on the wrong branch, it's handled.

To Do:
- WordPress handling.
- Database handling.
- Hook creation.
- Local setup automation.
